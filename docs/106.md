# 5.2.4监控机器性能

仿真不仅对验证建议的机器设计的正确性有用，而且对测量机器的性能也很有用。 例如，我们可以在仿真程序中安装&lt;quote&gt;仪表&lt;/quote&gt;，该仪表测量计算中使用的堆栈操作数。 为此，我们修改了模拟堆栈，以跟踪寄存器在堆栈中保存的次数和堆栈达到的最大深度，并向堆栈的界面添加一条消息以打印统计信息，如下所示。 我们还通过在`make_new_machine`中将`the_ops`初始化为

```js
list(list("initialize-stack", () => stack("initialize")),
     list("print-stack-statistics", () => stack("print-statistics")));
```

这是`make_stack`的新版本：

```js
function make_stack() { 
    let s = null;
    let number_pushes = 0;
    let max_depth = 0;
    let current_depth = 0;

    function push(x) {
        s = pair(x, s);
        number_pushes = number_pushes + 1;
        current_depth = current_depth + 1;
        max_depth = math_max(current_depth, math_max);
    }

    function pop() {
        if (is_null(s)) {
            error("Empty stack: POP");

        } else {
            const top = head(s);
            s = tail(s);
            current_depth = current_depth - 1;

            return top;
        }
    }

    function initialize() {
        s = null;
        number_pushes = 0;
        max_depth = 0;
        current_depth = 0;

        return "done";
    }

    function print_statistics() {
        display(accumulate((b, a) => stringify(a) + b,
                           list("\n", "total-pushes = ", number_pushes,
                                "\n", "maximum-depth = ", max_depth)));
    }

    function dispatch(message) {
        return message === "push"
            ? push
            : message === "pop"
            ? pop()
            : message === "initialize"
            ? initialize()
            : message === "print-statistics"
            ? print_statistics()
            : error(message, "Unknown request: STACK");
    }

    return dispatch;
}
```

练习 [5.15](105#ex_5.15)[5.19](105#ex_5.19) 描述了可以添加到寄存器计算机模拟器的其他有用的监视和调试功能。

<exercise>Measure the number of pushes and the maximum stack depth required to compute ![n!](../Images/9dc6259785da3af5bb9d517f330964af.jpg) for various small values of ![n](../Images/493731e423d5db62086d0b8705dda0c8.jpg) using the factorial machine shown in Figure <ref name="fig:fact-machine">[5.11](99#fig_5.11)</ref>. From your data determine formulas in terms of ![n](../Images/493731e423d5db62086d0b8705dda0c8.jpg) for the total number of push operations and the maximum stack depth used in computing ![n!](../Images/9dc6259785da3af5bb9d517f330964af.jpg) for any ![n%20%3E%201](../Images/7e0f0014bb76cd0cfd31c1ce37ce0acf.jpg). Note that each of these is a linear function of ![n](../Images/493731e423d5db62086d0b8705dda0c8.jpg) and is thus determined by two constants. In order to get the statistics printed, you will have to augment the factorial machine with instructions to initialize the stack and print the statistics. You may want to also modify the machine so that it repeatedly reads a value for ![n](../Images/493731e423d5db62086d0b8705dda0c8.jpg), computes the factorial, and prints the result (as we did for the GCD machine in figure <ref name="fig:gcd-with-io">[5.4](96#fig_5.4)</ref>), so that you will not have to repeatedly invoke `get_register_contents`, `set_register_contents`, and start.<button class="btn btn-secondary solution_btn" data-toggle="collapse" href="#no_solution_105_1_div">Add solution</button>There is currently no solution available for this exercise.

Hacker wants a _breakpoint_ feature in the simulator to help her debug her machine designs. You have been hired to install this feature for her. She wants to be able to specify a place in the controller sequence where the simulator will stop and allow her to examine the state of the machine. You are to implement a function `set_breakpoint(![machine](../Images/81264b0c4245e889b186409afc4d6ba0.jpg), ![label](../Images/728d445fc7e434bce80e0277d7736475.jpg), ![n](../Images/493731e423d5db62086d0b8705dda0c8.jpg));` that sets a breakpoint just before the ![n](../Images/493731e423d5db62086d0b8705dda0c8.jpg)th instruction after the given label. For example,

```js
set_breakpoint(gcd_machine, "test-b", 4);
```

installs a breakpoint in `gcd_machine` just before the assignment to register a. When the simulator reaches the breakpoint it should print the label and the offset of the breakpoint and stop executing instructions. Alyssa can then use `get_register_contents` and `set_register_contents` to manipulate the state of the simulated machine. She should then be able to continue execution by saying `proceed_machine(![machine](../Images/81264b0c4245e889b186409afc4d6ba0.jpg));` She should also be able to remove a specific breakpoint by means of `cancel_breakpoint(![machine](../Images/81264b0c4245e889b186409afc4d6ba0.jpg), ![label](../Images/728d445fc7e434bce80e0277d7736475.jpg), ![n](../Images/493731e423d5db62086d0b8705dda0c8.jpg));` or to remove all breakpoints by means of `cancel_all_breakpoints(![machine](../Images/81264b0c4245e889b186409afc4d6ba0.jpg));`<button class="btn btn-secondary solution_btn" data-toggle="collapse" href="#no_solution_105_1_div">Add solution</button>There is currently no solution available for this exercise.
